# Stroke-Risk
🧠 Stroke Risk Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes stroke risk factors using a healthcare dataset of 5,110 patients. The goal is to identify key demographic and medical indicators associated with stroke occurrence and provide actionable insights for healthcare decision-making.

The dashboard was built using Microsoft Power BI and DAX to create interactive KPIs and risk segmentation analysis.


📊 Business Objective

To identify high-risk patient segments based on:

Age

BMI

Glucose level

Hypertension

Heart disease

Smoking status

This dashboard helps healthcare professionals understand patterns behind stroke prevalence and prioritize preventive care strategies.
